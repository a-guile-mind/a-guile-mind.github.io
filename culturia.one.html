    </h2>
    <p>
      I restarted working on my personal search engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It used to be called culturia [0] with too many planned features. At
      some point, I called it asylum [1] and focused on personal knowledge
      base aspects and the last iteration was called gotofish [2]
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>[0] https://framagit.org/a-guile-mind/culturia</li>
      <li>[1] https://framagit.org/a-guile-mind/culturia.next</li>
      <li>[2] https://git.sr.ht/~amz3/guile-gotofish</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I learned much from all this projects. In particular, I learned that
      it will be a long long long project, even if I focus only on "personal
      search engine" line of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last iteration, gotofish, was not too bad even if it has bitrot.
      Based on my research and practical experiment, it seems very clear
      that there is no workaround the use of map-reduce, that might be known
      as n-par-for-each [3].
    </p>
    <p>[3]
      https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Parallel-Forms.html#index-n_002dpar_002dfor_002deach
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a prototype similar to that n-par-for-each, except it works
      with guile-fibers, is asynchronous and works with a shared pool of
      threads instead of spawning N threads for each incoming query like
      gotofish does.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Yeah, I am back in GNU Guile land. With yet another good name for the very same project that boils down to fight
      boredom, learn new skills and bring back the power to the computers of every lambda users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick flashback: I started with a minimal bulletin board more than 15 years ago. It was all good, and some
      success, lost all the backup and to repeat the same mistake: poor software pratices. Nevermind, it was mostly
      copy-pasted LAMP stack code written on Windows 2000. The lost backups will haunt me back for sure. But what does
      not?! Then I tried with Python, Django, Flask, MongoDB, Neo4J, PosgreSQL, Whoosh, skipped ElasticSearch, read a
      few hundreds of lines of Lucene documentation and code. Dozens of science papers. Enjoy Ordered Key-Value Store
      all the way down. Re-discovered fuzzbuzz. Learned Scheme. gnunet is making progress. Dozen of prototypes on
      various subjects. I have a very good idea of the graphical user interface in terms of web stack (to get the
      project started). Various good good discussions happening around rdf, AI-KR, GOFAI. And a glimpse into proprietary
      commercial system that have great success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, more or less, a roadmap for the next five decaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have two immediate pain points:
    </p>
    <p>
      gmail. I hate that interface. I much prefer inbox. I could upgrade ff.js framework. But meh. And Gambit is missing
      some library. I tried to help but then lost interest, temporarly, because the next point is more important.
    </p>
    <p>
      Search engine overall user experience: simply said I want to own all the data I search and that should not be
      scatered in various privative or hidden sqlite files! I want an IDE of my research adventures. I do not want to do
      3 or more clicks and fail to retrieve the paper I read 3 days or 3 years ago that is now not publicly accessible.
      I want to ban medium.com from my search results. But still, unhide it in case of boredom or emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      You prolly guessed, that I want a personal search engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is in no particular order pieces that I think are missing in GNU Guile:
    </p>
    <p>
      headless firefox driver for crawling Single-Page-Application,
      a smart crawler (see what use Common Crawl),
      news.ycombinator.com (meh) html snapshot,
      stackoverflow html snapshot,
      quora snapshot? not sure it is possible, it is a walled garden,
      wet/warc file parser,
      Common Crawl support,
      Somekind of wet/warc file consumer that will (only) build page/domain ranks.
      A fork of Grammar Link in pure Guile (with minisat bindings) to... check pages grammar.
      a word2vec and paragraph2vec similar to Gensim and Spacy that would allow to finger print the subject of domains /
      webpages against wikipedia vital articles hierarchy.
      Sure all this stuff can be put together in a few days by a junior architect using a franken-assemblage, to quote
      myself:
    </p>
    <p>
      We could argue indefinitly that one or more of those requirements are unnecessary, overkill and YAGNI. We could
      argue that by relaxing a few of the requirements, a particular software or set of softwares can come close. We
      could argue endlessly that building yet-another-database [or search engine] is NIH, wheel re-invention that curse
      the software industry with fragmentation and fatigue. We could invoke UNIX philosophy, entreprise software
      architectures, experiences, know-how, failed patterns, decades of good services and big communities.

    </h2>
    <p>
      <p>
        The dominance of Google cannot be infinite. Blockchain based internet searchers have the potential to become a leader in this field. All BBSEs are still at the beginning of their journey.
Today Google controls most of the search market, and it has taken two decades, with massive investments in time, money and knowledge. Assuming that the best BBSEs start to live up to their potential today, it will take at least ten years for Google to start feeling the pinch.
      </p>
      <p>
        The block-chain projects industry is experiencing parabolic growth as many successful projects are open source. The famous Bitcoin has a number of quite successful forks. Litecoin, Bitcoin cash, Dogecoin are all forks of Bitcoin. Dogicoin showed its usefulness after using it to raise funds to sponsor the Jamaican bobsleigh team for the 2014 Olympics. Today, the <a href="https://coindataflow.com/en/currency/dogecoin">coindataflow</a> exchange rate is still at an acceptable level, although it is experiencing some volatility.
